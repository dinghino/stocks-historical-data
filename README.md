# stocks-historical-data
Fetcher &amp; Parser for stocks historical data

Built on Python 3

Readme coming soon!

## Quick how to

setup your virtualenv (or not, up to you)

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* go into the root folder of the repo

`python .`

Navigate through the CLI, either with the shortcuts or vim/arrow keys, to edit your preferences, then run the scraper (**r**)
Once it's done you should have your output in your defined folder, defaults to `<root>/data/output/`

Data is pulled for now only from [FINRA](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) short interest reports, but I plan to add more sources when possible.
